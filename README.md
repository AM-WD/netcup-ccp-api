# Netcup CCP API

This project aims to implement the [netcup CCP API].

## Overview

The intense is to support a full netcup CCP API as described in their [endpoint].

At first only the DNS API is implemented, as that is the part personally needed.

The completion of the Reseller API will be done step by step as it cannot be evaluated by execution.
